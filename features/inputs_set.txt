This is a list of the variations that get set in the features.  This is a starting
point for finding out what variables can be set once at the deployment level and
then read from the deployment instead of having to save it in a class variable
that only persists for the current run.

#
# When running full troops from scratch this can be set to the 
# deployment id.  It's not going to be restarted in the middle.
# During dev re-using the snapshot lineage will work the majority of
# the use cases.  
# CHANGE TO USE DEPLOYMENT ID FOR lineage
    Then I should set a variation lineage
  @runner.set_variation_lineage
ebs.rb:    def set_variation_lineage(kind = nil)
mysql.rb:    def set_variation_lineage(kind = nil)



# This is going to be set to the deployment ID.  Check if it exists
# if so use it, if not create it.
    Then I should set a variation ELB_NAME
  @runner.set_elb_name
elb_runner.rb:    def set_elb_name
    def initialize(args)
      @elb_name = "#{ELB_PREFIX}-#{rand(1000000)}"

========================================================
These inputs are static between monkey runs - either because defined in
the feature or specific to the vmonk server running the tests.
Setting them to the same value each run is no big deal

# If the front ends are running then the will have the same private dns
# re-writing this to the deployment is no big deal
# if they just came up then they will be written to the deployment the
# same as was done in the past

    Then I should set a variation LB_HOSTNAME
  @runner.set_lb_hostname
application.rb:    def set_lb_hostname
    def get_lb_hostname_input
      lb_hostname_input = "text:"
      fe_servers.each do |fe|
        lb_hostname_input << fe.settings['private-dns-name'] + " "
      end
      lb_hostname_input
    end

# Set in feature - always same thing
    Then I should set a variation mount point "/mnt/ebs"
  @runner.set_variation_mount_point(mnt)
ebs.rb:    def set_variation_mount_point(mnt)
      @mount_point = mnt
    end

    Then I should set a variation stripe count of "3"
  @runner.set_variation_stripe_count(stripe)
ebs.rb:    def set_variation_stripe_count(count)
      @stripe_count = count
      @deployment.set_input("EBS_STRIPE_COUNT", "text:#{@stripe_count}")
    end

    Then I should set a variation volume size "3"
  @runner.set_variation_volume_size(size)
ebs.rb:    def set_variation_volume_size(size)
      @volume_size = size
    end


# Looks up the DNS id via deployment href.  Uses if exists, grabs a new one
# if not
    Then I should set a variation DNS provider
  @runner.setup_dns("virtualmonkey_dyndns")
mysql.rb:    def setup_dns(domain)
    Then I should set a variation MySQL DNS
  @runner.setup_dns("virtualmonkey_shared_resources")
mysql.rb:    def setup_dns(domain)

# This is set to the vmonk tester IP.  This can (and should) be set every run.
    Then I should set a variation for connecting to shared database host 
  @runner.set_master_db_dnsname
deployment_runner.rb:    def set_master_db_dnsname

========================================================
These are variations that are used in chef only features.  Ignoring for now

    Then I should set a variation bucket
  @runner.set_variation_bucket
mysql.rb:    def set_variation_bucket

    Then I should set a variation LB_HOSTNAME
  @runner.set_lb_hostname
php_chef_runner.rb:    def set_lb_hostname

    Then I should set a variation for connecting to shared database host 
  @runner.set_master_db_dnsname
php_chef_runner.rb:    def set_master_db_dnsname
